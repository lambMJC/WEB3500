explaining github

github is best described as a code hosting website that allows people to view and help with your code. It also allows you to let certain people connect to your code, download it, make changes, and send it back to the repository.

Github is a great way to connect developers together and code together on a single piece of code.

You might think there might be some issues with others injecting codes and changing whatever they want, well they have a solve for that issue. If someone messes up the code and/or changes something that shouldn't be changed, Github allows you to roll back different uploads of the code to get what you lost, so you dont have to do it all over again. They do this by reloading each "commit". So, when someone changes a code or uploads a new file etc. it asks them to commit to the changes and each change is recorded, allowing you to go back and go to every change or commit of the code.
